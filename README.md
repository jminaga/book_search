# book_search
<br> Heroku deployment issues. App runs locally but does not work when deployed to Heroku

<br> This project was to take starter code with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end. .
